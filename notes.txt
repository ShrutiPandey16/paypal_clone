Quick concepts first

HttpStatus — an enum of HTTP status codes (200 OK, 201 CREATED, 404 NOT_FOUND, …). Use it to tell the client what happened.

ResponseEntity<T> — a complete HTTP response: status + headers + body.

.body(obj) — build the response with a body.

.build() — finalize the builder without a body (useful for 404, 204, etc.).

ResponseEntity.created(URI) — convenience builder for 201 Created that also sets the Location header to the URI of the created resource.

ServletUriComponentsBuilder — helper to construct URIs pointing back to your controller (used for Location header).

@ResponseStatus and ResponseStatusException — alternate ways to set status codes (useful for exceptions / controllers).

Common HTTP statuses & when to use them (cheat sheet)

200 OK — success, body returned (GET, successful PUT returning resource).

201 CREATED — resource created successfully; include Location header pointing to new resource.

202 ACCEPTED — request accepted for processing (async).

204 NO CONTENT — success but no body to return (DELETE or successful action with no content).

400 BAD REQUEST — validation error / malformed payload.

401 UNAUTHORIZED — authentication required / failed.

403 FORBIDDEN — authenticated but not allowed.

404 NOT FOUND — resource not found.

409 CONFLICT — duplicate / conflict (e.g., unique constraint).

422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY — semantic validation failed (optional).

500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR — unexpected server error.
